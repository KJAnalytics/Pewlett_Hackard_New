# *** The Silver Tsunami - Succession Planning for Pewlett-Hackard***
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
As with many companiesin the United States and Globally - planning for the wave of retirements with the aging Baby-Boomer Generation is hitting home for Pewlett Hackard. Economic changes, COVID/health concerns, and corporate climate/cultural changes are hitting companies harder with rising retirements than in the past. Pewlett-Hackard is among those companies desiring to focus their efforts on identifying critical knowledge/skill holders and how to manage the organization without experiencing wave after shock waves of Boomer retirements potentially resulting in gaping holes in the organization. 
In order to address these potential losses, the Silver Tsunami project has been commissioned to work in a Postgres environment linking valuable information from 6 large databases of employee departmental, and financial information to understand the risk potential. All of this is geared towards informed succession planing and development of a mentorship program where critical positions will have targeted mentorship in order to set up the company for success with a new generation of leaders.

## Project Overview
This project is designed to link 6 large HR and Employee databases via PGAdmin and SQL in order to provide the following:
- A large Retirement database linking critical employee measures: employee_no, Titles, Names, Dates of employment, and Titles/Roles within the organization for all employees.
- Through refinement and focus on the active employee population born between 1952-1955, identify the immediate impacts to the company and short term risk to the organization. 
- Provide targeted outputs via tables linking the retirement populations to department level and Title/role impacts.
- Further refine the dataset to focus on employees born in 1965 (the end of the baby boom) to develop a tabular listing of potential employees for the mentorship program development and execution.  Utilizing this group of retiring employees "to pay it back" to the organization and focus on development of current employees to fill critical skill/knowledge spaces within the organization by providing this mentorship to the next generation of leaders.
